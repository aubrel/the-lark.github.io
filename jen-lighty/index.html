<h3>Even the Light Resists Going Down</h3>
<p>Laid out on a dock, belly exposed,<br />a man kneels next to me,<br />strikes a brass bowl<br />with a wood mallet.</p>
<p>When he circles the rim<br />with a motion that appears to begin<br />in his shoulder<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an egret<br />plucks a shining fish out of the water<br />and swallows it whole.</p>
<p>In the <em>palapa</em> behind us<br />a baby screams,<br />shakes her fists,<br />kicks the sun.</p>
<p>It seems like the laguna is<br />waiting for something to happen,<br />but it’s already over.</p>
<p>The family in Aleppo is gone.<br />The black snake has crossed the river.<br />The atmosphere is a broken border<br />anything can get through.</p>
<p>The fish can be seen struggling<br />inside the egret’s white throat.<br /><br />Although this appears to begin<br />and end with bodies,<br />a spiraling hand connected<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to a shoulder,<br />the sound<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is passing through.</p>
<p>The baby keeps crying.<br />She will not be comforted.<br /><br />Where it began<br />or how,<br />where it is going-<br />I wish I knew.</p>
<p>Beneath the dock<br />minnows dispersed by rings of sound</p>
<p>that echo in the egret’s belly<br />gather again in my shade.</p>
<p>You can see right through them<br />to the water’s other side.</p>
