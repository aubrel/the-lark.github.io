From the Vault</p><p>The illogic heat of that July night, the<br />throat of the opera-house open, clam-<br />ivory against gold of brick, thrown wide to<br />the oven-door city. And that song –</p><p>some stray cause undulating –<br />some old conviction meandering –</p><p>saulting its steps through a dissonant<br />dark, booming at gold and clanging through<br />moonlight, thrumming as sunrise in<br />the string of the wind, growling louder and louder in<br />mantic harmony, whirling momentum and giant<br />grace in a madcap careening of clarity –<br />An albatross winging for its life.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II. Stray Flowers</p><p>Double-dutch of carnival color by the auto zone,<br />Slipped in there somehow down on the five-mile tarstrip,<br />Laughs of pure sun-shot vaulting on clownleg stilts of jungle jade<br />Tumbling sixteen feet of summer through the egg-stink of engine oil –<br />Just bearing witness by the laundry dust,<br />Just speaking the truth to powder,<br />Another hallelujah by the tire-heap.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
