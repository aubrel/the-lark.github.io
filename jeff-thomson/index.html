<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; —Andrew Wyeth, Watercolor and Graphite on Paper</p><p>It’s the late light that gouges<br />at the heart, really. November’s end<br />and the leaves down. Birch trunks<br />and the calligraphy of shade.<br />Cold light, clean light. In a square<br />of it wooden plovers on the mantle<br />preen in a room so Spartan<br />it could be being punished for<br />something, the way the woods<br />in winter are punished with snow,<br />the way the wind channels down<br />through the gaps in the mountains<br />and finds the hearth of the sea<br />cold and dark in some room<br />abandoned somewhere and empty.</p>
