You know him<br />from a thousand film clips. He’s waiting</p><p>for you to say something interesting,<br />waiting for you to say <em>bomb</em><br />and not mean the club you hit</p><p>the night before where the lights<br />spun and zipped like carbonation<br />and the music was a second heart</p><p>in your chest and the girl with<br />the glitter and eyes like an Egyptian<br />touched your lips with her wrist</p><p>and misted away into the crowd<br />But when you say it that way<br />you’ve dated yourself and the story’s</p><p>not so fresh anymore, and<br />the detective has finished his chips<br />and he feels the lack of bourbon</p><p>precisely (he’s cursing you now)<br />and he desperately wants you<br />to hang up or incriminate yourself.</p><p>So say something for him, bring him<br />into the lonely acre of your life, tell him<br />a story, how once long ago you set</p><p>that garage on fire with an aerosol can<br />and a bic, how the sudden union of<br />the flame and the curtains made you weep</p><p>until the fire brigade arrived, too late, and —<br />as the effervescence of their lights<br />flung itself into the faces of the dark</p><p>summer maples—stood around speculating.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
