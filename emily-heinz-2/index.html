<p><a href="../emily-heinz/">Read Part I.</a><br />Â </p><p>This collection of syllogisms is living. It is the attempt of to parse the nature of photographs as works of art. They are currently unfinished,&nbsp;edited from time to time according to the thinking as the thinking arises.</p><h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>I.</strong></h3><h3 class="text-align-center">The art photograph is all that is its own situation.</h3><h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>II.</strong></h3><h3 class="text-align-center">the art photograph is not a transmutation of actualities; it is its own actuality.<br /><br /><strong>III.</strong><br /><br />the camera is not a neutral tool, but a mechanism with its own internal dialectics. the living technology of the camera informs necessarily the visual elements: shutter speed has a direct relation to the sharpness and stillness of lines, or of blurred light; aperture relates directly to depth of field, lenses can produce flatness or depth of image. these things belong properly to the camera.</h3><h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>IV.</strong></h3><h3 class="text-align-center">THE PHOTOGRAPH CANNOT RIGHTLY BE CALLED A TRANSFORMATION OF A SCENE THROUGH PERSPECTIVE. IT CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED THE MACHINATION OF THE CAMERA.</h3><h3 class="text-align-center"><strong>V.</strong></h3><h3 class="text-align-center">YET, THE CAMERA IS IN CONTINUOUS RECIPROCITY WITH ITS MASTER.</h3>
