<h3>the murder mystery poem</h3>
<p>knows who did it with the candlestick<br />on the train of itself running the long night<br />through to the Orient expressly for the purpose</p><p>of discovering all that it knows already, the frayed<br />strands of this tenuous plot, the who-done-it-ness<br />of the pistol on the mantle waiting for the lights</p><p>to come down and moment to be pregnant enough—<br />and <em>pregnant enough</em> is enough of a motive isn’t it,<br />really?—for the shot in the dark, for the knife</p><p>that shines wickedly and winks from the flashlight<br />carried into every car on this damn train, running on<br />and on with the front visible from the back now</p><p>as it takes the bend in the mountains. But<br />the second class are passengers revolting<br />(<em>they certainly are</em>, says the poem, sniffing)</p><p>now against the intent of all this intrigue<br />that would have them killed off one by one<br />like so many redshirts in the Science Fiction poem.</p><p>At this point the plot should have thickened<br />like tar, the bubble and stench of the creosote banter<br />of the—where the hell is that detective anyway?</p><p>He’s shellaced in the back with the gorilla<br />in the cage, the whole story turned to sitcom.<br />They’re passing a bottle back and forth</p><p>and singing into the drawn-out night<br />the train tunnels through because<br />he has long ago given up hope</p><p>of discovering the villain who opens<br />the door to the tiny washroom,<br />and sees <em>your </em>face in the mirror</p><p>stroking and stroking the foam<br />from the delicate skin of your throat with<br />a straight razor’s long and elegant blade.</p>
