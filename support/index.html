<h3 class="text-align-center"><br /><br /><strong>THE LARK IS FUNDED BY OUR READERS.</strong></h3><h3 class="text-align-center">+</h3><p>The Lark is able to support artists and thinkers by virtue of support from people who believe that the liberty afforded by digital space is an opportunity to nourish the life of international creative work. The Lark is made possible by and for those who want it to be what it is without selling advertising or subscriptions simply because we asked people if that was something they would be willing to help make real in the world. The answer was and continues to be a resounding yes, and for that, we thank you.</p><ul></ul><p class="text-align-center">If you would like to support The Lark, you can do so in the following ways:

<p style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Join us for our first anniversary and semi-annual fundraising soiree in New York!</em></strong>
<br>
On March 24<sup>th</sup>, 2018 at Topos Bookstore in Ridgewood, Queens, NYC, The Lark will welcome in readers and contributors for an evening of free wine, gnoshing, and celebrating The Lark. The NYC editor, Em, will talk a little bit about the experience of running an online magazine over the last year, and how we have watched this magnificent beast take flight. We will of course also be accepting funds to keep the wind in our sails and food in the bellies of our artists, so please do bring whatever little contribution you are able to. Digital or cash contributions are accepted with equal gratitude. There will also be a chance to mingle with some of the NYC-based artists who have been featured in previous issues, as well as the issue due to launch the second volume of this beloved digital journal.</p>
