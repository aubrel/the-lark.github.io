<p>Hey, Suitmouth, watch where you point that thing.<br />Your words break tiers of beryl, facet-bright.</p><p>Hospital aquariums crushed and gutted by your gutlessness,<br />teal Mosques of clear air,<br />Golden Gates of free faces.</p><p>Swallow your ox-tongue before you bull into this Metropolitan;<br />go chew your own eyes before you hood-gag your neighbor's face.</p>
