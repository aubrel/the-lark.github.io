My dear colors</p><p>are incriminated in sanitary sheets. Lit from below by the reflective surface we buff and rebuff.<br />Operated on for educational purposes. Stuck-up in broad daylight. Made examples of.</p><p>Do we reel in the street-lit dark we despise? Do we pluck samples from sheets of sweets? Our<br />colors run. Like crosshairs tragicomically caught in the crosshairs. Like all-night-party people.<br />Like chorus people. Like datamoshers. Like color runners.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I drag my tempera across a fictive palette for your admiration. My bitter odor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is lost upon a swell of plaster.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I, violent mascot, drown in paint chips.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abraded tie dye effigy, defiant in some respects.</p><p>Another I of stolen colors skulks, penalized in a bedroom. Cuffed to an armoire, awaiting bread<br />and sword, violet lip to nacreous hand. Another wishes to better serve its master, ultraviolet fury.<br /><br />The colors infight, remap the prismatic territory. I run in gauzy sheets. Panache and verve are<br />nowadays widely hated, and so too, are you.</p><p>Were you dazzled by the sentimental sepia?<br />Dash out that florid monochromy.<br />Evince a tremulous hue.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
