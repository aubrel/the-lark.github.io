<h3 class="text-align-center"><em><a href="../jen-lighty">&lt; PREVIOUS</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></h3><h3><strong>jen lighty</strong><br /><br />crossing the border</h3><p><br />It seemed that the bus rose<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without effort up the green mountain<br />into a cloud of butterflies tossing themselves<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like confetti over the road.<br /><br />The light on the face of the boy sitting next to me<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; was the reason I left home,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bones shining pharaoh gold<br />under tight skin turned toward the open window<br /><br />where three white horses stood without moving<br />as we passed, heads bowed to each other in a triangle of trees<br />left standing in the dirt front yard of a cinderblock house,<br />occupants unknown.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you more about them,<br />but it is the dream I want most—<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the light<br />on the boy’s cheekbones,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the fluttering butterflies<br />earthbound.<br /><br />At the border, men groped through chain-link<br />to change our money. A gray cat slipped through a gash<br />like fog that disappears as you walk into it.<br /><br />There are colors in the fog that can only be seen<br />with eyes closed.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
