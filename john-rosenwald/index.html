<h3>
    <strong>Editorial Response</strong>
    <br />John rosenwald
</h3>

<p>
    When asked if I consider this creation—
    <br />your writing—sufficient cause for my elation;
    <br />when you begin to tout your inspiration,
    <br />your accolades proclaimed throughout the nation,
</p>
<p>
    I soon discover in my consternation
    <br />a second understanding of the situation:
    <br />Your work displays an intimate relation
    <br />to what I see as artificial self-inflation.
</p>
<p>
    And so, if urged to complement success
    <br />through future publication, I confess
    <br />the option causes me acute distress.
</p>
<p>
    Your work’s less fresh than forced, less
    <br />wise than cute, less poetry than verse. With due respect
    <br />I’ll choose to move ahead. Not to regress.
</p>
