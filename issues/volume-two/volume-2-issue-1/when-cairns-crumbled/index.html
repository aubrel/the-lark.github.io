You—camping alone in the hinterland—
don’t eat these ruby red berries
clumped together by sap. Beyond those
tail-swishing horses, over the ravine,
go past the tall pine all hikers know.
You’ll find a hackberry bush just before
the cliff, its seeds more protein-rich
than all the markets east of here.
