<pre>
They left me for dead
down in the ravine
where ironweed stood firm
amid butterfly carcasses.
After the wolves came,
a silence: crushing,
wider than the prairie
where singular cattlemen
rocked and puffed
their pipes and beyond
the manure composts
a garbage man walked,
covered in grime,
dragging a corn stalk.
