The<br />actor’s staged accent made<br />the actual children ecstatic,<br />a broom passed over granite<br />just before rain. Music<br />withheld from such heavy<br />air fell audible/inaudible.<br />The garden path had a crystal<br />structure with properties<br />of growth, but as the message<br />carved into the shell of a<br />souvenir turtle kills the turtle<br />in time, so did that pattern<br />of clearings wither the plants.<br />The quantity of hope, like<br />the narrative of effort, fits<br />snug within the magnitude<br />of chance. Given time, I’ll<br />clarify the wine. But even<br />birdsong can’t train<br />the climbing vine.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
