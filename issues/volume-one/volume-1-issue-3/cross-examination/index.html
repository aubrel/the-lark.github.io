<h3>
    <strong>CROSS-EXAMINATION</strong>
    <br />Cameron Morse
</h3>
<p>Garden mums unpack parcels of yellow<br />petals, opening jaundiced eyeballs<br /><br />on a mid-September morning. Southwestern<br />wind rummages through the oak leaves<br /><br />for a lost object, the daystar, perhaps,<br />smothered in oak leaves, or the wayward<br /><br />cricket heard chirping in the furnace room<br />while we tossed in bed. In the cross-examination<br /><br />of sunrise, blurred shadows and soft light,<br />itâ€™s impossible to locate the original source<br /><br />of any testimony, no matter how long one sits<br />and examines the evidence of the senses.</p>
