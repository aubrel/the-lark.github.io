    Poem: 东方红日Hongri Yuan
    <br />Translation: Yuanbing Zhang
</h3>
<p>一万五千年前<br />你是个国王<br />而三万年前<br />你是个奴隶<br />你的前世是一册册时光长卷<br />而来世呢 一万年何其短暂<br />昨天空无 明天空无<br />此时你在何处<br />空无 空无 如来的光环 空无的笑容</p><p style="text-align:justify"><br />Fifteen thousand years ago<br />You were a king.<br />And thirty thousand years ago<br />You were a slave<br />Your past life was a long scroll of times<br />And the next life? How short ten thousand years are!<br />Yesterday is emptiness and nothingness,<br />Tomorrow is emptiness and emptiness<br />Where are you at this time<br />Emptiness and nothingness, emptiness and nothingness<br />Buddha halo, the smile of emptiness and nothingness</p>
