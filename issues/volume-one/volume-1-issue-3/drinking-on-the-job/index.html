<h3>
    <strong>DRINKING ON THE JOB</strong>
    <br />Clyde Kessler
</h3>
<p>I’m almost drunk in a coal mine<br />and it feels like an empty sky inside<br />wearing midnight for a helmet lamp.<br />Jackie Betkin squeaks like a bat<br />beside me. Larry Crowley is waving<br />his hands, and nobody can see him.<br />Oh, we know we violate all safety.<br />Just like the boss, just like inspectors.<br />Oh, we know the coal veins mock us.<br />Maybe there’s a fuse, maybe the auger<br />gouges past blind rock. Sunlight keeps<br />dragging heaven off from where we are.<br />We know this. So Larry drums the wall.<br />Jackie yells. I just wish this whiskey<br />didn’t dribble down my chin, such waste.</p>
