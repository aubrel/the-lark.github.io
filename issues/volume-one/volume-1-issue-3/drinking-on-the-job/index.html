Larry Crowley is waving<br />his hands, and nobody can see him.<br />Oh, we know we violate all safety.<br />Just like the boss, just like inspectors.<br />Oh, we know the coal veins mock us.<br />Maybe there’s a fuse, maybe the auger<br />gouges past blind rock. Sunlight keeps<br />dragging heaven off from where we are.<br />We know this. So Larry drums the wall.<br />Jackie yells. I just wish this whiskey<br />didn’t dribble down my chin, such waste.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
