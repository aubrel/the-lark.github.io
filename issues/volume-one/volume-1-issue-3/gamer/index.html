<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's play two!</em>&nbsp; --Ernie Banks</p><p> </p><p>I don't want to die but if I have to<br />Miss Hooker says that I'd <em>certainly like</em><br /><em>Heaven better than Hell.</em> And I have to,<br />die that is, one day. I hope it's a long<br />way away. Sometimes time is like distance.<br />And in Hell I'd just suffer, <em>suffer worse<br />than here on earth</em>—<em>far worse</em>, Miss Hooker says<br />and she should know, she teaches Sunday School<br />to me and my classmates. To get to Hell</p><p>is easy, she says—<em>just keep on sinning</em><br /><em>and you'll be there before you know it</em>, like<br />it can't wait for me and comes creeping close<br />to turn up the heat so slowly that I<br />will hardly notice but when I die still<br />it will stun me, my soul anyway, my<br />body will be busy rotting away.<br />But if I want to go to Heaven then<br />I'd better mend my ways and give my life</p><p>to Jesus and pray everyday like<br />I mean it. But it gets complicated<br />because, Miss Hooker says, <em>Adam and Eve<br />were the first sinners</em>, which means they <em>brought sin</em><br /><em>into the world </em>and it's been here ever<br />since, we're even born into it, which stinks.<br />But I don't make the rules so what I've got<br />to do is try never to do it, sin<br />that is, even though I want to and I</p><p>will, it's <em>inevitable</em> she says. But<br /><em>Jesus died a horrible, lingering</em><br /><em>death to save our souls</em>, so if I believe<br />that He's the Son of God and my Lord and<br />Savior and anything else about Him<br />I'm leaving out--I guess that's a sin, too<br />—and try not to be a hypocrite and<br />see no evil, hear no evil, and speak<br />no evil, like those monkeys on our wall<br />calendar--then the chances that I'll get<br />to Heaven after I die are pretty</p><p>fair. I'm going to sin but I shouldn't<br />but I will anyway but I shouldn't<br />but I <em>will </em>so I must pray everyday<br />to Jesus to forgive me all my sins<br />even if I don't know what some of them<br />are. Just to be on the safe side. The truth<br />is that I wish I didn't have to die<br />at all. Then I wouldn't go anywhere.<br />I hope it's not a sin to pray that, like<br />I did last night, but I PS'd to it<br />that if I never had to die I'd try</p><p>like the devil not to sin—I call that<br />a good deal and I guess in time I'll know<br />if God accepted it. I hope He won't<br />outsmart me by never letting me know<br />that I'll live forever. I'd hate to be<br />two-hundred years old and still never know<br />if I might get up dead the next day. <em>That</em><br />would hurt. Still, I'll have set a record, not<br />the same as Methuselah's but this is<br />the Modern Era, like baseball--I mean</p><p>more traveling. More challenging pitching.<br />Better equipment and conditioning.<br />Better chow. Sharper fans. They're on their feet.</p>
