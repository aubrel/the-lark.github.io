<h3>
    <strong>PARADISE</strong>
    <br />ANDY STALLINGS
</h3>
<p>While the carousel circled<br />and sang, I cut tunnels under<br />syntax to let my secrets run.<br />Forced into correspondence<br />with a list, I rolled like a<br />coastal storm, traffic cones,<br />trash barrels, diaper flaps,<br />clear-shelled shrimp strung<br />from my central motor.<br />There’s no key for turning<br />the fury of meaning inward<br />that isn’t already stuck in lock<br />and assembly. So I sit in<br />the meaning of your eyes.<br />If you’ve had your way with<br />the sentence, I’m palpably<br />vacant, a vessel, ready for<br />blood. Is this why I strike<br />deep into other hearts, to<br />stake my churn to some castle<br />that could be my keep, or<br />keep me alive.</p>
