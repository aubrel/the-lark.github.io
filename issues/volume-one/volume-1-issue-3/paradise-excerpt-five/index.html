<p>Of course, no one ever says,<br />“you can’t leave the house<br />and walk to the toy store<br />without us when you wake in<br />the morning and your<br />parents are still asleep.” My<br />father was famous for such<br />mishaps, as when he torched<br />his mustache blowing out a<br />burning marshmallow, and<br />twice dumped an extendable<br />grill full of hot dogs into the<br />campfire. There are walks I’d<br />take and walks I wouldn’t,<br />with or without you, not<br />parallel in time. The silence<br />ascending afternoon in a<br />large suburban house, no<br />need to leave the neighbor-<br />hood, only the desire<br />to leave. The fish were guilty<br />of nothing, the garden low<br />and silent beside the rocks.<br />Exposed bone, sharpened<br />and used for a tool. This isn’t<br />intended as nightmare.<br />Though there is no getting,<br />from where we’re going,<br />here.</p>
