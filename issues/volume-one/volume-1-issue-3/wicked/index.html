<h3>
    <strong>WICKED</strong>
    <br />Gale Acuff
</h3>
<p>This morning Miss Hooker asked me how much<br />I was going to give the Lord today.<br />She meant how much loot would I give to God<br />in the collection plate, the loot I mean,<br />not God, though He's everywhere, even in<br />the nickel that I tithed. She's my Sunday<br />School teacher, is Miss Hooker. Sometimes I<br />want to give my money to her instead.<br />She's kind of like God, or closer to Him<br />than I am. Anyway, she works for Him,<br />at church I mean. It's really my parents'<br />nickel--they don't come to church but send me<br /><em>to represent the family</em>, Father says.<br />They sleep late on Sundays. When I come home<br />they're not even dressed. The kitchen's full of<br />Sanka-smell and cigarette smoke and that<br />stink of color-comics in the Sunday<br />paper. Prince Valiant and Dick Tracy and<br />Tarzan, who's pretty naked for Sunday<br />morning. I have to sleep in pajamas<br />but I'm thinking about dropping them—not<br />wearing them I mean. What my folks do is<br />send me to church with a dime but if they<br />give me two nickels instead I keep<br />one sometimes. There's a word for that and it's<br /><em>stealing</em> but then my allowance is low<br />so I'm just trying to right a wrong and<br />it's probably God's moolah anyway<br />—what does God need with money?—but at least<br />I don't take it all. Sometimes I feel bad<br />about that and Miss Hooker tells us<br />if we die without being forgiven<br />for our sins, which Jesus will do if we<br />ask Him to and mean it, then we'll go to<br />Hell when we die and it's a wicked place,<br /><em>wicked</em> means pretty damn bad, all that fire<br />and torture and they last eternally.<br />She says that's not the kind of eternal<br />life we want. She shakes her head back and forth<br />kind of like a puppy killing a sock.<br /><em>What we want's eternity in Heaven</em><br />—she snaps her head up and down, up and down.<br />And like I say she works for God. So I<br />told her, The usual. Then she told me<br />that while I'm still young I <em>should learn to give<br />'til it hurts</em>—also <em>learn to sacrifice<br />like Jesus did</em>. But he died on the Cross<br />I reminded her. <em>And you must die, too</em>,<br />she said, laughing—<em>you must die and be born</em><br /><em>again</em>. Yes ma'am, I said. If you'll kiss me.</p>
