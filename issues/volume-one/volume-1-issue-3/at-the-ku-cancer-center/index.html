<h3 class="text-align-center"><a href="../the-myth-of-voice">&lt; PREVIOUS</a>&nbsp; |&nbsp; <a href="../cross-examination">NEXT &gt;</a></h3><h3><strong>At the KU Cancer Center</strong><br />cameron Morse</h3><h3> </h3><p>In waiting room, where I pilgrimage myself,<br />to be weighed and blood-pressure<br />cuffed, Pulse-Oxed and body-temped<br />once every four months, Lili nudges<br />my arm and points to her belly<br />without a word, as though he were listening<br /><br />and might stop if he heard us. In the exam room,<br />she sits on table paper while the nurse<br />of my oncologist tells me to follow<br />her finger with my eyes, her finger drawing<br />invisible lines of a star, or the sign<br />of the cross. Her hands waggle right and then left,<br /><br />left and then right, to test my peripheral<br />vision. Feeling new strength<br />in my palsied arm, I wrap my hand<br />around her fingers and pull, pull, pull her<br />toward me. Push, push, push her away.</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div>
