Wind arranged<br />the boughs, and beneath<br />them there was music, if<br />you’d call the irritable<br />squabbling of children music,<br />and I would. But the<br />windows didn’t open, not for<br />me, or not for long. A habit<br />of hoping for particular<br />outcomes even in realms of<br />chance. A blue morning. I<br />take the eggs from the carton<br />and scramble the interiors,<br />discarding the shells. I say<br />blue, but it isn’t. “Oh,” says<br />the toddler, “Oh, right.”</p>
