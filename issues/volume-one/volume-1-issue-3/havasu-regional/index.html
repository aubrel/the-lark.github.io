<h3 class="text-align-center">&nbsp; |&nbsp; <a href="../drinking-on-the-job">NEXT &gt;</a></h3><h3><strong>Havasu Regional</strong><br />Clyde Kessler</h3><p> </p><p>Sand is dragging rain from moonlight.<br />Every cactus feels the moisture. A rattler<br />tongues the air, and soon sneaks the water<br />to its heart. The old man who left us last spring<br />points at lightning, then they both disappear.<br />He’s hooked to a machine that helps him breathe.<br />He’s almost a number tonight, an average<br />that says storms fall apart on a dragon’s head,<br />fires steal oxygen, and creatures die gazing<br />at sand. He married somebody that our mother<br />believed was a friend. He’s breathing south<br />of Colorado, as if swizzling a view inside a hospital<br />feeds his veins. My uncle says this is punishment.<br />Grandma says we should be reconciled sooner<br />than never. Particles from a trillion stars<br />linger inside the curtains and the window glass.<br />I pretend their light feels like sand scratching<br />heartbeats from the waiting room I left.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
