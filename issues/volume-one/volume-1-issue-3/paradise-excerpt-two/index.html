<h3>
    <strong>PARADISE</strong>
    <br />ANDY STALLINGS
</h3>
<p>Every thought’s “been<br />thought” by the time you<br />think it. A series of signs that<br />leads one not to a town<br />or a pier, but to a condition<br />of grace. And the table, soft<br />beneath my wrist, does not<br />disagree. Music of multiple<br />harmonies and rhythms from<br />a countryside that knows its<br />accordion and its dance. She<br />walks through a vineyard<br />slowly, toward a dirt road<br />scattered with stones and<br />ceramic shards. Such a still,<br />it must be a mirror, or a<br />mire. It isn’t nothing, it’s not<br />dramatic, people living their<br />lives as simulacra, weather<br />shifting, movement caught by<br />the eye but barely, no<br />resolution of plot. A mind is<br />a pattern of habits. There is<br />no end to the end of beauty.</p>
