<p>I grin when the earth fools me<br />in the ground where my kinfolk<br />mined coal, so I wouldn’t have to,<br />so I could escape their drudging<br />home and job. Their smiles look<br />like thin smudges, with such days<br />their quiet happiness real enough<br />to fly past me. One says don’t<br />divine anything from the silence,<br />or the words. Another just reheats<br />yesterday’s biscuits for my breakfast,<br />and leans back and helps me<br />be haunted, then free, then old.</p>
