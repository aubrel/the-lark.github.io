Their smiles look<br />like thin smudges, with such days<br />their quiet happiness real enough<br />to fly past me. One says don’t<br />divine anything from the silence,<br />or the words. Another just reheats<br />yesterday’s biscuits for my breakfast,<br />and leans back and helps me<br />be haunted, then free, then old.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
