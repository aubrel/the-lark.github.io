<p>I hope Miss Hooker goes to Heaven like<br />she keeps saying she wants to—she's big on<br />God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost and<br />she's my Sunday School teacher, nobody<br />I know or even don't comes nearer to<br />God so I hope she finally gets to<br />meet Him, I'll bet He's heard lots about her<br />but of course He made her after all and<br />with a lot of attention to detail,<br />red hair and green eyes and freckles, I mean<br />Miss Hooker. I don't know what God looks like<br />but He'll have to go some to out-fine her.<br />Me, I'll be going to Hell, I guess, she<br />tells me so herself every Sunday,<br />how if I keep sinning and don't get saved<br />even though I'll still sin but not as much<br />and not so heinously, I'll go to Hell<br />and be tortured and Don't say I didn't<br />warn you. She did. And the rest of the class<br />—she warned the whole lot of us but wouldn't<br />it be something if when I land in Hell</p><p>I'll find her there? I wonder if she'll say<br />I told you so. Boy, will my face be red,<br />as red as her hair going up in flames<br />but maybe she won't be able to see,<br />my red face, I mean, for all the fire and<br />blood and brimstone, whatever that is. Then<br />it'll probably hit me that she's just<br />as embarrassed as I am. But I won't<br />rub it in. I'll forgive her. That's righteous.</p>
